# BlogSystem

This is a simple Blog system

First I thinks about it as admin and user
so the main part of the project is the post 
what are the main properties of the post like (comments,username,published date, etc...) 

So first i started to build post Class (Code First)
then other related POCOs like (comments,User and PostCategory)

I am no using any architecture until this moment 
but i am going to use Onino architecture in the next stage

How to use it
1-you can view all postes but you can't comment on any of these until you logged
2- you can register as normal user or admin
3- admin can add posts and assign alread category or add new one

if you have any question, you can comment of project
or send to me at petertharwatmezaree21@gmail.com
